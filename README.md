# age-calculation
This Python script calculates a person's age in years, months, and days based on their input.
It also accounts for leap years to provide an accurate calculation of the total number of days. The program uses Python's calendar and time modules to handle date-related operations.

Features

Leap Year Calculation: The script accurately accounts for leap years when calculating the total number of days.
Month Day Calculation: It computes the number of days for each month, including adjustments for leap years in February.
Error Handling: Input validation is included to ensure the user enters a valid age (non-negative integer).
Modular Design: The code is organized into separate functions for leap year checks, month-day calculations, and age computation, making it easy to extend or modify.
